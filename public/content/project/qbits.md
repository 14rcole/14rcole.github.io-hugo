This project was done for LehighHacks Spring 2016.  The app takes a csv file with power consumption data from an automated lighting system. It then uploads the information to the server where the information is processed and visualized back down in the app.  The user can see graphs of data for power consumption over different periods of time and adjust different variables to see how power consumption would change given certain changes to the system.
