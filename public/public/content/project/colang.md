This project was more for the learning experience than anything else.  I wanted to discover a bit more about how functional programming languages are implemented.  So I decided to build one.  Along the way I've learned quite a bit about programming in C as well.  This includes everything from the linking, to setting a coding style, to formatting files and the code within them such that the project can easily be scaled as it grows.  The project is far from finished.  In fact, it's just getting started!  That being said, I've already learned a ton from it and am really looking forward to what the rest of the project has in store.
