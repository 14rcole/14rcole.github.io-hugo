      <description>&lt;p&gt;OSTree is a tool that combines a &amp;ldquo;git-like&amp;rdquo; model for committing and downloading bootable fiesystem trees, along with a layer for deploying them and managing the bootloader configuration.  It was designed so that package managers, system upgrade tools, etc. can use OSTree as a &amp;ldquo;deduplicating hardlink store.&amp;rdquo;  Recently, OSTree has become popular for use with containers.  However, many platforms that work with container do so in Go.  This library provides a set of Go bindings for OSTree that mimic the command line as much as possible so as it make it easy for container teams to use OSTree.&lt;/p&gt;
