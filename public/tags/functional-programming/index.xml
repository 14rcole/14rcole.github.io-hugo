      <description>&lt;p&gt;This project was more for the learning experience than anything else.  I wanted to discover a bit more about how functional programming languages are implemented.  So I decided to build one.  Along the way I&amp;rsquo;ve learned quite a bit about programming in C as well.  This includes everything from the linking, to setting a coding style, to formatting files and the code within them such that the project can easily be scaled as it grows.  The project is far from finished.  In fact, it&amp;rsquo;s just getting started!  That being said, I&amp;rsquo;ve already learned a ton from it and am really looking forward to what the rest of the project has in store.&lt;/p&gt;
